## User Story

Hey! I'm Evan Alioto. I'm currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp provided by UCSD Extension. I've always had the desire to learn how to code but never had anyone around me to help direct me, so I decided to just jump straight into it. So far I've been having a blast and the content I've been learning has helped affirm my desires to get into coding. My goals with all of this is to switch careers in order to pursue something I'm passionate about. I hope you enjoy my portfolio page and please don't be afraid to reach out! Thank you for your time.

## Description

My homework for this week was to create a Weather app that allowed users to input a city name and have it display weather values for the city entered. I needed to have a current weather section and a 5 day forcast section which required multipul API calls from the openweatherapp API. The hardest part of this project was getting and appending all of the information from the API call to sit neatly in my html file.
